# Background of project

## Objective
The dataset was retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The objective of the project was to compose visualisations to shed light on conflict and food aid in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the visualizations had to demonstrate whether there is an association between food aid and conflict.

## What was done
- Extracted the variables from the database site that are relevant to the objectives and then combined them into a separate data frame as the master data frame to start with
- Data cleaning and processing were performed to verify the quality of the data and to ensure the correctness of variable data types
- Plotted visualizations (bar charts, scatterplots) between variables using the ggplot2 package to understand the relationship between them and ultimately forming insights that fulfil the objectives
