# Background of project

## Objective:
The dataset was retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The objective of the project was to compose visualisations to shed light on conflict and food aid in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the visualizations had to demonstrate whether there is an association between food aid and conflict.

## What was done:
- Extracted the variables from the database site that are relevant to the objectives and then combined them into a separate data frame as the master data frame to start with
- Data cleaning and processing were performed to verify the quality of the data and to ensure the correctness of variable data types
- Plotted visualizations (bar charts, scatterplots) between variables using the ggplot2 package to understand the relationship between them and ultimately forming insights that fulfil the objectives
